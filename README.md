Let's say you're managing a simple online store and you want to keep track of your products and orders. Here's what you can do:

Set Up SQLAlchemy: Start by setting up SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database.

Define the Database Schema: Create tables for Product and Order. Each order can contain multiple products, so you'll need to establish a many-to-many relationship between them.

Perform CRUD Operations: Implement basic CRUD operations for managing products and orders.

Here's a basic outline:

Product Table: Contains information about each product, such as its name, price, and quantity available.

Order Table: Represents individual orders placed by customers. Each order has an associated customer name and a list of products along with their quantities.

You can then implement functionalities like:

Adding new products to the inventory.
Placing orders for products.
Updating product details (e.g., price, quantity).
Retrieving information about orders or products.
This task should provide you with good practice in setting up database relationships and performing CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy. 
Feel free to ask for more specific guidance or hints if needed!
